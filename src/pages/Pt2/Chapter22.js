              I loved that debate. I felt so alive and that I belonged where I was. It was so simple, but I was able to talk and share my opinions. I usually don't like to speak, so I have literally no clue what happened. With chemistry, I can see the chemical composition, but this just felt different. And here's the thing: I want to do it again. To my surprise, however, Mr. Garcia says just what I want to hear. <br/><br/>
    "So class, that wraps up our practice debates. Next week today, we are going to have debates that actually count towards your grade. You will select your topics today and then prepare for the next week. Tomorrow, I'll hand out the formatting and other information you will need."<br/><br/>
    After announcing, the rest of the kids were chatting amongst themselves. Myself, however, I was keenly watching Mr. Garcia as he writes the topics on the board; a few of them the same as today, but a few new and more interesting ones. Most specifically, the one about human cloning. Nothing particular about the topic, but rather how it immediately caught my attention. However, now that I think of it, it's not really something I want to talk about. 
    As I wait for him to finish up with the list, I notice one more: politics—It's the perfect mix, interesting and formal. The specific topic was: All citizens of Canada should have an equal annual income. Alright, I've decided I want to do that one.<br/><br/>
    "Students, if you could take a look at the board, here is a list of topics. Take a second to read through them, and then come to my desk to get it assigned."<br/>
    Since everyone has been talking, I get the competitive advantage by picking first. I immediately get up and head to his desk.<br/>
    "Hey, Ryan. It's been really quick. You found a topic?"    <br/>
    "Yes. Equal annual income."<br/>
    "Alright and proposition or opposition?"<br/>
    "Opposition"<br/>
    "And you're in! Thank you"<br/><br/>
Very quickly, I head back to my desk and vigorously write. Using the same idea framework from the practice debate, I start brainstorming some ideas.
    Over the next couple of days, I spend time working on what I'm going to say and then develop my script. I think it's terrific. There's only one problem: I don't want to say it. I don't want people to judge me. <br/><br/>
    "Hey, dad."<br/>
    "Yeah, Ryan"<br/>
    "I have a debate coming up in class. But I don't want people to judge me. What do I do?"<br/>
    "You think people are going to judge you? Absolutely not! Tell me this, is your content good?"<br/>    
    "Yes"<br/>
    "Then that's all that matters. When you give a good point, people will respect you. Trust me"<br/>
    "Alright, I do trust you."<br/>
I have good content. It will be fine.<br/><br/>
Finally, the day of the debates come. In the morning, I take one last look at my notes and build up the confidence I need to speak. After a deep inhale and exhale, I change into my best (and only) suit and head to the car. I want to build that reputation of actually knowing stuff. I am different, 
but being autistic shouldn't hold me back! Just as I head into class, I remind myself of what I keep telling myself. Be confident, Be knowledgeable, Be Prepared. It's time.<br/><br/>
    "Good afternoon, everyone. You probably know today is time for debates. We will go in order of the debate names."<br/><br/>
    Alright, that means I'm 5th. Not bad. On the downside, however, everyone is just staring at me in a suit. Is it because I'm autistic or because people don't usually wear suits to school? I'm going to stick with both. <br/>
    One by one, the debaters go up and make their boring arguments - very obviously scripted. The only problem is that mine might also be scripted.<br/>
    Very quickly, I take out my papers and add some pathos. That is something that he taught us and told us that he would greatly prefer. I think it's better now. <br/><br/>
    "Thank you so much. And now we will have the fifth group. First up, the proposition."<br/>
    As the proposition went, I noticed some of their arguments. This works perfectly. Everything she spoke about is exactly what I oppose in my argument. <br/>
    "Thank you for the propositional speech. Now can we call on the opposition, Ryan?"<br/>
    Slowly, I head up to the front. One step at a time, I mentally prepare and make sure that they will appreciate what I say. I look over to Mr. Garcia, he nods at me, and I give him a subtle one back.<br/><br/>
    "In a theoretical world, it would be perfect if everyone had the same income. No fiscal discrimination, and everyone gets the same resources. However, this afternoon, I want to present to you why this would cause a society's downfall. Presuming that at least one of your family members or relatives goes to work, they obviously work for the money and assets. By bringing in the strategy proposed, the complete value of their work would be destroyed. "<br/><br/>
    The proposition brought up a point that people would be able to do what they pursue. This is definitely a good idea; however, alongside comes no value to what they are doing. "A professional and well-known doctor or CEO of a large company would make the same income as a failed artist. Knowing how to perform surgery or making big financial decisions is vital for society. An economic recession is almost guaranteed, with a potentially corrupt government run by those solely passionate rather than skilled. You can't drive a car with passion, but you can with knowledge and skill."<br/><br/>
    "As you can see today, by bringing in this strategy, the world would only see chaos—no value of work and no motivation to thrive means no reason to work. We live a long life, but we require the drive to work to make a significant impact. No one stops you from finding your passion, so such a policy would not cause any greater good. Thank you for your time."
    <br/><br/>
It's a tiny rock in the mountain of success. Ryan did not realize it, but this debate on this day, changed his life.
