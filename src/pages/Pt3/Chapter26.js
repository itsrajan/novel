              It’s been a month. I’m ready. I’ve worked hard. It’s time to face Mr. Johansen. I quickly collect my things and head to his secretary.<br/>
    “Is Mr. Johansen available?”<br/>
    “Yes. You can go right in.”<br/>
As I head on in, Mr. Johansen’s face is not happy but not angry at the same time. <br/>
    “Ryan. It’s been a while. How have you been?”<br/>
    “Fine. I want to talk to you about last month’s request.”<br/>
    “Oh, I can’t seem to remember… could you remind me?”<br/>
    “You said I could shadow a case. If I do a month of work.”<br/>
    “Hmm. I do recall that”<br/>
    “It’s been a month.”<br/>
    “You know, I’m not sure if it's the best thing.”    <br/><br/>
Wait, hat? If I can’t get this, then that is a month wasted.<br/>
    “But you told me that I could. I worked, and I’m ready.”<br/>
    “You know what. This Thursday, I’m putting Dayla on a case, and I think you should shadow. Does that work?”<br/>
    “Yes”<br/>
    “Well, then that is great. You should probably know her by now, so I’ll let both of you get acquainted.”<br/><br/>
My work has come to be valued, and I will not let him down. Without hesitation, I head on over to Dalya in hopes of learning. <br/>
    “Hi Ryan, how are you?”<br/>
    “Mr. Johansen said I could shadow your case.”<br/>
    “I’m doing well, thank you.”<br/><br/>
Well, this is awkward.<br/>
    “I’m sorry.”<br/>
    “No worries! Yeah, he did mention something a while back. How is it going to work?”<br/>
    “I’ll just be listening in throughout the process. If it’s successful, then I will follow what you do.”<br/>
    “And if I don’t win?”<br/>
    “I’m not sure. But my dad always told me to plan for the best.”<br/>
    “You know what? That’s a good idea. Let’s do this.”<br/>
    “Thank you. We can start on Thursday.”<br/>
    “Sounds like a plan.”<br/><br/>
As I head home, my eagerness overwhelms me as I know I will finally be able to view a case. I know it isn’t much, but it's a work-in-progress, and sooner or later, I’ll actually be doing a case.
    After what felt like a million years, finally, Thursday arrived. I woke up with such enthusiasm and an exhilarating mindset. I’m definitely prepared. I get to work early today because I was up with the earlier 6:58 bus available. Quickly, I walk faster than ever and sit at my desk, waiting for Dayla. After waiting for about 20 minutes patiently, she finally arrives, and I greet her with a rare smile. <br/><br/>
    “Someone looks very happy today.”<br/>
    “I’m just excited. This is going to be fun.”<br/>
    “I sure hope so. My last case was extremely boring.”<br/>
    “I don’t care if it is boring. It’s going to be interesting, and that’s what counts.”<br/>
    “I like how you think. This should be interesting.”<br/><br/>
The next few days were, what’s the word… remarkable. There is so much I didn’t know about the legal process. In school, we focused more on what happens in court, but it never really came to my attention about how intensive it is behind the scenes. It’s like a stage: all the acting is fun, but the preparation and crew are what holds up everything in the end. This four-week process was like none other.
    Once we were in court, everything just came together so smoothly. It felt like I was baking a pie, where the investigation was the crust, the preparation was the filling, and then the final result was the delicious confection. Dayla spoke so well and undoubtedly convinced the jury. What Mr. Johansen said is that the new people in the firm will always work the hardest, and although I didn’t like this comment, it really paid off in the end. I’m definitely going to use this format and preparation for my future cases; she is someone I look up to. <br/><br/>
    In the end, the jury came out and shared their verdict. My heart almost stopped as I awaited the news. I wasn’t playing a key role in the case, but a win here would be equally cheerful for me.<br/>
    “The jury finds the defendant innocent on all charges.”<br/><br/>
My heart starts racing, and I stand up with joy. As I give Dayla a firm handshake, I truly understand that I want to do this.<br/>
    “Hey, Ryan! Celebration dinner?”<br/>
    “No thanks. I’m feeling a little tired. I’m still beyond happy for you.”<br/>
    “Thank you so much. It means the world. See you next week.”<br/><br/>
I never thought that I would become a lawyer and be in this position. The most interesting thing of all, however, is that my journey had only begun. 
    After a week of reading through the paperwork and remembering my favourite parts, I head back to work for my next initiative. I really hope that Mr. Johansen is in a good mood. <br/><br/>
    “Hi, Ryan. How was your case? I heard Dayla won”<br/>
This took me a while to answer. I just found it so difficult to explain how happy I was in words.<br/>
    “Ryan?”<br/>
    “It was good.”<br/>
    “That’s great to hear. How can I help you?”<br/>
    “I want to do more.”<br/>
    “Well, I was sure that you would approach me. What do you want to do this time?”<br/><br/>
Even though he sounded a little annoyed, I wanted to make sure he knew what I wanted.<br/>
    “To do a case. I know how it works, and I’m confident in my success.”<br/>
    “You know... it’s not that easy.”<br/>
    “I’m ready.”<br/>
    “Given that it's your first case, I’ll give you a simple one to start. You can work with Andrew on it. If all things go well, then the future of your career will only build further. I just want to make sure that you are ready.”<br/>
    “Because I’m autistic?”<br/>
    “Not at all! Because you’re new.”<br/>
    “Dayla is new. She’s already had 2 cases.”<br/>
    “Dayla had a job before this and was here for a month longer than you. You’re already getting your first case, so I’m sure it’s all good”<br/><br/>
Well, it looks like he had all the answers and the right ones too.<br/>
    “I just want to make sure I’m not being treated any differently.”    <br/>
    “I can assure you that it won’t happen, but I count on every associate to only take on what they can succeed at. That’s your responsibility.”<br/>
    “As long as you’re sure. High school and university were tough where everyone doubted me, and I understand. I’m ready.”<br/><br/>


    “Nothing to worry about. As you said, you’re ready.”
