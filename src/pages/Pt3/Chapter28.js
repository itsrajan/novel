              I am trembling in fear. I’m not sure how else to put it. Given that this is one of the biggest moments of my career, I must take this with utmost caution and attention. It is more than important to make sure I make the right impression—calm yet powerful, casual yet formal, factual yet approachable. 
    As I head into the building alongside Andrew and a few others from the team, I notice a lot of publicity. I’ve been to a few cases which may have had the odd reporter, but this is just overwhelming. Walking into the courthouse with blinding flashes of cameras and the reporters' extraordinary bellows, this was a mess. Quickly I head to Andrew to ask what is happening.<br/><br/>
    “Why are there so many people?”<br/>
    “They’re here for you. Word must have gotten out that an autistic lawyer was doing a case, and this is the type of stuff publishing companies feed off of.”<br/>
    “But I’m just doing my job.”<br/>
    “Trust me, I don’t get it either, but they’re just trying to do their jobs. Don’t answer any questions and follow closely behind me.”<br/><br/>
Progressing through the halls, we finally reach the entrance, where the massive doors greet me. This isn’t a relatively nice courtroom based on what I’ve seen in other locations, but this is a big moment. 
    With pride and confidence, I walk in only to notice the biggest surprise of my life. I see my father and brother sitting there waiting for my entrance. After seeing them, my heart almost stops, and I smile with the most content I have had in years.<br/><br/>
    “Ryan! Congrats!”<br/>
    “Hello”<br/>
    “This is such a big moment! Come here!”<br/><br/>
Even though I’m supposed to stay beside Andrew, I quickly head over and give my dad and brother a hug.<br/>
    “This is amazing, but I have to go and do my case. I’ll see you right after!”<br/>
    “Go ahead. We love you.”<br/>
    “Love you too.”<br/><br/>
Going towards my seat, I start remembering everything that Andrew and I prepared for… or at least I try to. I don’t want to let my dad down, and I don’t want to embarrass myself in front of the press.<br/>
    “Andrew. I’m scared. You do the case.”<br/>
    “Absolutely not!"<br/>
    “What?”<br/>
    “This is your moment, your family is here, and most importantly, you are the most qualified. Trust me. You’re ready. Take a deep breath, and I can guarantee that you will be outstanding.”<br/>
    “Promise?”<br/>
    “I promise.”<br/><br/>
I take a deep breath, think about what brought me to this moment and get out my notes. After a few moments, I hear the main door closing and wonder what’s going on.<br/>
    “All rise for the Honourable Judge Jeffords.”<br/>
I stand up and fix my tie. I want to make sure I look presentable and that I am treated the same. <br/>
    “Thank you, everyone. Please be seated. Does the Government have their opening statement?”<br/><br/>
As the opposing side stands up and presents their argument, I start feeling less confident. It’s only an opening statement, but the jury isn’t going to like me because I can’t speak. After about 6 minutes, the time comes that I’ve been waiting, for years. <br/><br/>
    “Thank you. Will the opposition present their opening statement?”<br/>
    “Yes, your honour.”<br/><br/>
However, as I begin to speak, everything doesn’t work. I open my mouth, but nothing comes out. Why is this happening?<br/>
    “Your honour. Could I have a minute, please?”<br/>
    “Sure. With your condition, that seems reasonable.”<br/>
I’m used to this kind of language, but Andrew was not. Out of the blue, he gets outraged.<br/>
    “What!? How could you say that!?”<br/><br/>
The only problem was that he was talking to a respected judge.<br/>
    “Excuse me? It would be in your favour if you didn’t speak like that.”<br/>
    “He’s a human being, and he’s allowed a minute. I’m sorry if that didn’t meet your expectations.”<br/>
    “Mr. Nguyen. I advise you to stop talking and not address the court unless it's an absolute emergency. Got it?”<br/>
    “Andrew. It’s fine. I got this."<br/><br/>
Slowly, I take a quick breath, and the words start flowing. My confidence grows exponentially, and I start doing everything we prepared for and much more. The words coming out of my mouth are everything that a court could ask for.<br/>
    “Thank you, Mr. Williams. Will the Government present their first witness?”<br/>
    And the case just began. Back and forth, we just spoke and presented what we had prepared. Most people refer to the law as a series of judicial cases, but I find it a combination between debate, conversation and the social good. <br/><br/>
    In this case, my cross-examinations were extraordinary; I set up the alibis and witnesses perfectly and executed a perfect conclusion… not to brag. There is this concept that I know about called the ‘zone,’ which is what I learned during my Psychology university class. It is this moment when individuals feel like they can do anything inside an environment they love. Right now, I am in the zone.
    The next day as the case concluded, the jury came out with the verdict. I look over to my dad with a huge smile and then close my eyes with hope.<br/><br/>
    “Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. The juries have come to the verdict that the defendant is guilty. Thank you”<br/>
    My heart stops. <br/><br/>

I look down and then slowly look towards Andrew.<br/>
    “It's perfectly alright. It’s your first case, and you did amazingly well.”<br/>
    “But I lost.”<br/>
    “Ryan. Here is one thing that you don’t understand just yet. This is not about winning or losing - it’s about the effort you provide and the thought you give. Tell me, do you think that you did the best you could?”<br/>
    “Yes. But I still lost.”<br/>
    “That doesn’t matter. You had an amazing case. I don’t want you ever worrying about a result. Trust me, that was one of the best cases I have ever seen.”<br/>
    “Alright”<br/><br/>
Quickly, I walk over to my dad and brother.<br/>
    “Congrats Ryan!”<br/>
    “Why are you congratulating me? I lost.”<br/>
    “Trust me. You did not lose. That was an amazing case, and you know it. I’m so proud of you.”<br/>
    “Thank you. For this and everything, obviously”<br/>
    “Ryan. You are a change-maker. This is all you.”<br/><br/>
As I head on over the back to get my stuff, I am quickly interrupted by Mr. Johansen. He approaches me with a large smile and his hand out, waiting for a handshake.<br/>
    “Hi, Mr. Johansen. Thank you for this”    <br/>
    “No, Ryan. Thank you. You did lose, but our firm now has a lot of publicity, thank you! I will never forget your effort.”<br/>
Did he say that? I guess some people will never change. Some people are so focused on the reward than the actual thing that happened. Is he really the right person to be working for?<br/>
    “Hi, Andrew. That was amazing.”<br/>
    “No, you were. I’ve never seen you speak like that before.”<br/>
    “Well, I’ve never been that confident or ready for anything in my life.”<br/><br/>
After sharing a few good laughs, Judge Jeffords calls for me.<br/>
    “Yes, your honour?”<br/>
    “Ryan, what you did today was amazing. I not only wanted to apologize for what I said today but to tell you that you have a great future in law.”<br/>
    “Thank you, sir.”<br/>
    “Keep this in mind. You are going to change the world. Be prepared for what life throws at you, and you will impact millions, if not more. I know you’re ready.”<br/>
    “This means the world, sir. Thank you again.”<br/>
    “Anytime.”<br/><br/>

I want to be the one to help change how the world views autism. My actions today should not be a revolutionary concept. Just because I was born a certain way doesn’t mean that striving to reach my potential should be met with obstacles. <br/><br/>

I hope that my story inspires those labelled as disabled to make a difference in the world.
