              "Ryan, could you please wait in the office. I would like to speak with Ms. Stark very quickly."<br/>
"Why? But I thought this was our meeting?"<br/>
"No buts."<br/><br/>
I take a seat in the office, the same one, of course, and wait patiently. I look around nervously, looking for something interesting. I settled on a few paintings outside of Ms. Stark's office. The first one is a photo of her and her family. She has a husband and two daughters, who don't look like her that much. The image was probably taken in the summer because the sun was shining and the grass was green. I don't like the snow, especially when the roads are icy and sidewalks are slippery. I don't want something happening to me as it did to my mom.
The following photo was a Monet, or at least I think so. It's one of his most famous paintings, which I'm pretty sure is called The Water Lily Pond or something like that. Who was in charge of creativity back then? Was it just look at a painting and name it exactly as what you see? Now that I think of it, it seems like someone painted that. I'm pretty sure one of her daughters did it because there are some messed-up lines. I just like the painting for some reason… it's pretty relaxing.
Okay, back to the critical part. Why was my dad mad? I think this will be a perfect opportunity. <br/><br/>
I guess my dad is just looking out for me. I just really hope that I get to do this in the end. We only live once. Suddenly, I hear the door open and see my dad storm out. He looks angry.<br/><br/>
"Ryan, we're leaving."<br/>
"But-"<br/>
"We're. Going."<br/>
I don't like that aggressive tone. It usually means bad news. <br/><br/>
This was a pretty quiet drive home. I usually enjoy the silence, but I wanted to know what happened. <br/>
"What happened in the meeting?"<br/>
"We'll talk when we get home."<br/><br/>
I don't want to aggravate him anymore. After about another 12ish minutes, we arrive at our apartment and head inside. I sit on the couch, waiting for my dad. He gently sits next to me and what he says next is confusing.<br/>
"We are going to talk about school later today."<br/>
"But you-"<br/>
"Yes, I know. But I want to tell you something first."<br/><br/>
I stare at him awkwardly. What does he want to tell me?<br/>
"I want you to meet someone tonight?"<br/>
"You mean, like a friend?"<br/>
"No, no. Like, a woman. I met someone."<br/>
My heart stops. 
"Like… a girlfriend?"<br/>
"Yeah, kinda like that. I met her at the store, and she seems nice."<br/>
"You’re replacing my mother?"<br/>
"No, no, no. I've just been a bit lonely lately, and I like her."<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
"I just thought it would be nice. I invited her for dinner tonight."<br/>
"Well then, cancel it."<br/>
I stare at him intensely while clenching a pillow tightly. "I really don't care what happened in the meeting?"<br/><br/>
"Well, I told her that we weren't interested at the moment."<br/>
"What? But you didn't even talk to me!"<br/><br/>
"I don't understand this. Just because I was born with something different, I am forced to spend my day in a class where I do nothing. Just because I was born with something different, you make decisions for me."<br/><br/>
I try getting up and to go to my room, but my father quickly holds me back and brings me back to the couch. <br/>
"Let go of me."<br/>
"Ryan. Calm yourself. You don't understand. She is using you for publicity. She wants people to write articles about you. She needs you."<br/>
"I don't care"<br/>
"I promise! I'm telling the truth."<br/><br/>
"But why would you decline the offer?"<br/>
"We have all the leverage!"<br/>
"What?"<br/>
"She will do anything to get you in."<br/>
"It's always about you isn't it."<br/>
"No! You don't get it. You can have it work perfectly for you."<br/>
"No. You are confusing me. Bring over your new girlfriend and negotiate all you want. I am leaving."<br/>
"Ryan. Stop"<br/><br/>
He doesn't even bother trying to stop me. I go to my room to get my shoes, only to see Bobby on his bed. <br/>
"What's going on"<br/>
I don't respond.<br/>
"But you don't know where you're going!"<br/><br/>
No response again. I head out the doors, go down the stairs and get onto the sidewalk.
Bobby was right, and I don't know where I'm going. I look around, waiting for something to do, or at least some indication of where I should go—the faint smell of sewage, the loud sounds of the oncoming cars. I have no clue what I'm doing. <br/><br/>
Eventually, I reach an intersection, and I remember everything. I sit down on the bench on the very left seat and make sure not to touch anything. I look out to the road and think to myself the one question that philosophers, scientists and mathematicians have been asking for years: <br/><br/>

Why?
